# Code and Solutions to Coursera - Self Driving Car Specialization

Repo to store code while I work through the Coursera self driving car specialization.

Some of the code/scripts are solutions to examples presented in the videos.

Document, notes, and analysis of code/results can be found at

## Course1
Course 1 was mostly online quizes. Real coding assignments did not start until week 4.

### Week4
In week 4 the assignments were implementing a bicycle steering model, and a longitudal (speed) model.

## Course2 
Course 2 is around state estimation.
There are several lesson#.py scripts. These are programs that are used for either solving questions in the videos, or replicating some of the data sets presented in the video.
The most important one (in my opinion) is lesson6.py which implements the unscented transform on a generated data set, similar to the data set used in the video for this lesson.
